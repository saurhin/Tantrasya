      <h2>Consultations & Guidelines</h2>
      <p>At Tantrasya, I do not charge for consultations. Whether it's your first message or your tenth, guidance is offered freely, with sincerity and care.</p>
      <p>This path is not a business—it's a calling. Healing, clarity, and spiritual insight should never be limited by money or fear.</p>
      <p>If I ever recommend a crystal or remedy, it’s completely your choice to buy them or feel free to buy from anywhere. There is no pressure, no compulsion—only what resonates with you.</p>
      <p>You’re welcome to reach out, share your story, ask questions, or simply talk. This space is yours too, without conditions.</p>
      <p>All consultations are given with utmost sincerity and respect to your time and journey. However, to maintain balance and protect my energy space, please note the following:</p>
      <p><strong>Telephonic Consultations:</strong> Kindly request a specific time slot. Random calls during the day will not be entertained. A 10-minute delay is understandable, but beyond 30 minutes, the session will be considered missed or chargeable.</p>
      <p>I request everyone to value this time, as I too have my personal life, spiritual duties, and healing work to perform.</p>
      <p>Thank you for understanding.</p>
      <p>If you wish to seek help, surrender with faith, and the path will reveal itself.</p>

      <h2>Energy Exchange</h2>
      <p>The work I offer through Tantrasya is grounded in sincerity, presence, and care. While there is no fixed fee for consultations, each session carries its own depth — often involving time, energy, and unseen spiritual effort.</p>
      <p>If you ever feel moved to offer something in return — as a gesture of appreciation or alignment — you are welcome to do so. There is no obligation, only mutual respect. What is shared here flows from a space of trust, not transaction.</p>
