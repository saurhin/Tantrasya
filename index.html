        <h1>TANTRASYA</h1>
<h4>ॐ नमो भगवते वासुदेवाय - ॐ श्री गणेशाय नमः - ॐ नमः शिवाय </h4>
        <p>In this sacred space, ancient wisdom meets modern souls. Tantrasya is a journey — not to become someone else, but to remember who you truly are.</p>

            <h2>About Saurhin (Tantrasya)</h2> <!-- Updated heading -->
            <p>Namaste,</p>
            <p>I am Saurhin — a seeker, a guide, and a practitioner of traditional occult sciences, spiritual healing, and vibrational energy work. Tantrasya, meaning "of the Tantra" or "belonging to Tantra," is my sacred offering to the world. For many years, I have walked the unseen paths, helping people transform emotional wounds, karmic burdens, ancestral imprints, and energies that exist beyond the physical realm.</p>

<p>My practice flows through the timeless rivers of Tantra — honoring both right-hand and left-hand paths — and draws upon the shared spiritual essence found across many traditions. It is infused with mantra sadhana, crystal resonance, intuitive readings, and the subtle guidance of clairsentience, weaving together wisdom that transcends borders and beliefs.
</P>

<p>This space is not built for blind faith, but for conscious transformation. Whether you are someone newly awakening or an experienced practitioner who believes you have seen it all — if life has brought you here, perhaps something still awaits to be revealed. All are welcome, without judgment. Every remedy shared here arises from deep study, sadhana, and lived experience. With humility and strength, I continue to serve those who are ready to surrender, remember, and rise.</p>

    <!-- New Section: Consultations & Guidelines -->
    <section id="consultations">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Consultations & Guidelines</h2>
	At Tantrasya, every consultation is offered with sincerity, compassion, and deep respect for your journey. The work I do is not a business—it is a sacred calling. Yet, for true healing to flow, there must always be a balanced energy exchange.

All consultations and visits are offered on the following basis of sacred contribution:

Personal Consultation (In-Person): ₹2,500

Follow-up / Ongoing Guidance (Call or Online): ₹1,500

Home Visit – Energy/Paranormal Assessment: ₹4,100 (Mumbai region) / ₹5,100 + travel (outside city)

Crystals / Remedies (if required): As per material cost + ₹1,000 preparation

This is not a “fee” in the commercial sense—it is an honouring of time, energy, and sacred work. It also ensures that those who truly seek guidance come with sincerity.

🌼 Consultation Guidelines

Telephonic Consultations: Only after the first in-person session. Please request a specific time slot; random calls will not be entertained.

Punctuality: A 10-minute delay is understandable. Beyond 30 minutes, the session may be rescheduled or paused, depending on energy availability. Punctuality is a form of respect to both sides.

I request every seeker to value this sacred time, as I too have my personal life, spiritual duties, and healing work to perform.

Thank you for understanding. If you truly seek help, surrender with faith, and the path will reveal itself.

            <h2>Energy Exchange</h2>
            <p>Although consultations are currently offered without any fixed fee, the work involved often flows far beyond a single session — from channeling intuitive insights to preparing remedies and holding space through healing sadhanas.</p>

<p>If you ever feel truly supported, seen, or transformed through this process, you're welcome to offer a gesture of gratitude in any form. It is never expected, only received with humility — and always poured back into continuing this sacred path of service..</p>

            <p>“Most know Saurhin as an Origami artist and art lover—but few are aware of his deeper journey into the mystical and the unseen. Over the years, he has emerged as a trusted guide in Paranormal Investigations, Crystal Healing, and Occult Practices. With a wealth of experience and deep-rooted passion, he helps individuals navigate unexplainable phenomena, energy imbalances, and spiritual disturbances. His approach is both methodical and intuitive, combining traditional wisdom with modern insight.

At Anveshan, Saurhin offers transformative remedies for those suffering from issues like black magic, negative energy, or spiritual blockages. His healing work includes crystal therapy, sound vibrations, aroma healing, chakra balancing, and mantra chanting—each tailored to the individual's needs. I’ve witnessed how his remedies bring real, lasting results. There’s no magic wand here—just sincere work, guided by life science and energy awareness. If you're ready to put in the effort and trust the process, Saurhin is someone you can rely on completely.”</p>

            <p>"I recently connected with Saurhin and was amazed by his beautiful collection of healing stone accessories. His deep knowledge, passion, and the energy each piece carries make the experience truly special. He takes time to understand individual needs and offers thoughtful, personalized guidance—it's clear he genuinely cares about helping others through his work.

One turning point in my life was when I shared my career stress with him. Saurhin sensed my unrest and crafted a healing bracelet for me. I’ve worn it ever since, believing it shields me from negativity. Soon after, I was offered a new, tailor-made role in my company—something I hadn't imagined. I truly believe Saurhin’s energy, insight, and support played a powerful role in that transformation."</p>

For readers who love to read in details-
He doesn't advise you just to get crystals or stones which are generic but studies your case in deep for a few days dedicatedly and then only tells you which ones you really need, which ones are good to have and which ones even if you already have are fine to have or not.
After his analysis,he sends you a draft of it with all instructions. He answers your questions till your satisfaction.
His support doesn't stop here but also responds to you whenever you have any even silliest query.
Its unbelievable that he does all of this for free but it's true. Its 100% genuine. He never insists on buying from him. Also his prices are very cost effective compared to others. Take my word for it who has been to many of such healers.
I am so grateful to him for all his help and after care. I am really blessed to have him in my life who treats me like his own sister. God bless him.
